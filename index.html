		   in the text contained within the heading tags. Some search engines will give higher list position 
		   if keywords are used in the page title or heading. However, do not spam keywords, meaning repeating 
		   the words over and over within the content of the page. Search engines continue to become more 
		   sophisticated and spamming can prevent your page from being listed if it perceives you are trying to 
		   cheat the system.</p>

		   keywords as appropiate.</p>

	   <summary>Images and Multimedia</summary>
	   <p>Search engine robots do not see the text within your images. Configure meaningful 
		   alt text for images and include relevant keywords.</p>
   </details>
   <details>
	   <summary>Valid code</summary>
	   <p>While it is not required by search engines that your code be validated, well structured
